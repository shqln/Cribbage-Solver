purpose: select the best hand in a game of Cribbage

===========================
====Program Description====
===========================
This program can be used to determine the Cribbage point value of a player's
hand in the show stage in a game of Cribbage.
It can also find the hand of 4 cards out of 5 or 6 cards dealt to the player
that maximises the expected value of Cribbage points gained.
This is achieved by generating combinations of all possible start cards with
all possible selection of hand, and calculating their expected value to find
the one with the highest expected value.
